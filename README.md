# Excel-Model-To-R
Open Source Excel Model

The model outlined is the spreadsheet that was used to illustrate the principles 
of Markov modelling and probabilistic sensitivity analysis in the following two papers:

Briggs A, Sculpher M.  Introducing Markov models for economic evaluation. 
PharmacoEconomics 1998; 13(4): 397-409.

Briggs AH.  Handling uncertainty in cost-effectiveness models.  
PharmacoEconomics 2000 (forthcoming).

The model is made available for non-commercial teaching purposes only.

The purpose of this project is to translate this Excel model into R. 

If time permits, a probabilistic sensitivity analysis and/or the model in R studio coudl be created.
